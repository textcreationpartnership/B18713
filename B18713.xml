            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the several Landlords of <hi>White-Friers,</hi> the <hi>Savoy, Salisbury-Court, Ram-Alley, Mitre-Court, Fuller's-Rents, Baldwin's-Gardens, Mountague-Close,</hi> the <hi>Minories, Mint, Clink,</hi> and <hi>Deadman's-Place,</hi> in the name of themselves and the rest of the Landlords, of the Houses within those Places. Humbly submitted to the Honourable House of Commons.</head>
            <p>UPon passing an Act the last Sessions against the Corruptions of pretended <hi>Privilege-Places,</hi> particularly <hi>those</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; all Persons that were in either of them under <hi>danger</hi> of Arrests <hi>immediately fled,</hi> so that there soon was as <hi>free</hi> liberty to execute Process <hi>there</hi> as in any other Place whatsoever; <hi>the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of a Rescue being no less than</hi> 500 <hi>l. payment of the whole Debt, or Transportation:</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> upon any <hi>House-keeper</hi> that should <hi>therein</hi> harbour such as should commit, or be anywise assisting in a Rescue. And by the said Bill <hi>all Officers were impowered to BREAK OPEN Houses in those Places, in order to execute Process against either Body or Goods.</hi> Under colour of which some Robberies have been there committed, the <hi>danger</hi> whereof hath in effect <hi>banished</hi> many Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants from thence, that were under no danger from Creditors, and hath deterr'd <hi>many</hi> more from <hi>Inhabiting</hi> in such Places, where in their own Houses they could not be safe, as long as Bailiffs (in their private Characters generally the <hi>worst</hi> of Men) might break open their Houses, under colour of Process, and so at all hours <hi>fright</hi> both them and their Families.</p>
            <p>Now for as much as the <hi>main design</hi> of the last Bill [liberty of executing Process in those Places] will be <hi>effectually</hi> answered, without continuing that Power to Bailiffs of breaking open Houses.</p>
            <p>It's humbly hop'd this Honourable House will repeal that Power of breaking open Houses in those Places; seeing the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance thereof will <hi>banish</hi> most Inhabitants from thence, and <hi>prevent</hi> others from residing <hi>there,</hi> many refusing <hi>(for that Reason ONLY) to become Tenants upon payment of nothing but the King's Taxes;</hi> so that some Thousands <hi>per Annum,</hi> for that Cause only, are now in those Places not inhabited, and much more will become so, <hi>to the great loss of all the Landlords, and the utter ruine of many their Creditors and Dependants.</hi>
